# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. You can choose between two official plugins for Fast Refresh: [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md), which uses Babel, or [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc), which uses SWC.
